# diffusion-face-gen
This project creates a diffusion-based generative model to synthesize realistic face images by blending features from Orientals, Indians, and Europeans. Using a UNet architecture, it introduces and reverses noise, generating diverse images. The project highlights success in image synthesis while identifying areas for future optimization.
